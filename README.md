ANALYSIS

Through the data provided we can say with high confidence that Capomulin and Ramicane are the best Drug Regimen's
to stunt the growth of squamous cell carcinoma. The average tumor volume of these two drug regimens are at least 30% lower than 
Ceftamin, in third place.

We can also assume that Capomulin will have a positive impact on tumor volume over time, more than it has a negative impact on
tumor volume over time.

Lastly, there is a direct correlation between the weight of the mice and the SCC tumor volume of the rat. The heavier the mouse weighs,
the more tumor volume the mouse has.
